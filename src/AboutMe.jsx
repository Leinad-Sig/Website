    <p>    
        I’m Daniel Pinto, a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable, efficient, and well-structured applications. With over three years of experience in backend development, I’ve worked extensively with Ruby on Rails and Scala, while also gaining hands-on experience with JavaScript, Docker, and Kubernetes. Additionally, I’ve explored Python, C, Java, Spring, PHP, Laravel, and Flutter through academic and personal projects, continuously expanding my technical skill set.
    </p>
    <p>
    I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments, having worked in senior-heavy teams where I quickly adapted, learned from experienced professionals, and made meaningful contributions to impactful projects. Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring and supporting fellow developers, strengthening both my problem-solving abilities and communication skills.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of work, I’m always looking for ways to improve—whether it’s through gym training, climbing, reading, or taking on new challenges. I also enjoy video games as a way to unwind and explore new storytelling and problem-solving mechanics. My long-term goal is to refine my expertise, contribute to meaningful software solutions, and mentor aspiring engineers the way I’ve been mentored.
    </p>
    <p>
    I’m currently seeking new opportunities where I can apply my backend expertise, grow in a challenging role, and be part of a team that values innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
